              <p>In 1989, a group of people, propelled by the goal to continuously enhance and inculcate human values in the hearts and minds of every individual, joined resources and came up with a Buddhist Resource Center. As a result, WP was born, designed to be a home for Buddhist-inspired activities promoting human values in Education. On January 20, 2011, the groundbreaking ceremony of Wisdom Park took place. A sapling of the third generation from the original Bodhi tree under which the Buddha Himself sat was brought directly from Sri Lanka to the Philippines by no less than the Prime Minister of Sri Lanka, The Right Honorable D.M. Jayaratne and His Excellency Ambassador Nawalage Bennet Cooray.  The Planting of the Bodhi Tree was done by The Right Honorable PM and His Excellency the Ambassador, assisted by the Founder of Wisdom Park, Dr. Mariano S. Yupitun on May 15, 2011. By August 3, 2012, the Stuppa was consecrated by His Holiness the 41stSakyaTrizin and His Excellency Gyana Vajra Rinpoche.</p>
